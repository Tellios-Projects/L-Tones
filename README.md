There once was a mod called [ZTones](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/2221070-ztones-v-2-2-1-decorative-blocks-16x).
There once was a mod called [XTones](https://github.com/TehNut/Xtones).
There once was a mod called [XTones-Reworked](https://github.com/TobsenD/XTones-Reworked).
Now there is a mod called LTones.

This is both a fabric port of the Mod, and a full revamp by Tellio-Aridoitsu (Eliza) with some programming help by Leafenzo (Leah)
